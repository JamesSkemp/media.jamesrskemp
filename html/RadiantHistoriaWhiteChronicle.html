				This one is very tricky, as it has prerequisite choices to even access the
				sidequest, and the game doesn't tell you.  There are three decisions you have
				to make over the course of the game.

				1) During the "Breakthrough" node at Gran Plain (see GRAN1), head north one
				screen and west to the checkpoint.  You will hear someone in distress back
				east.  Make sure to choose "Let's go save her now."
				2) After the "Wolf in the Fold" node (see GRAN3), return to "Alistel's
				Offensive" and talk to Viola.  Return to the "A Meeting Too Late" node and
				proceed with the plot normally.  Make sure to choose "I leave it to you."
				3) During the "Commander's Fall" node at the Sand Fortress (SAND6), defeat the
				Thaumaton boss at the end.  Afterwards, make sure to choose "Bring back now."

				Despite that last decision occuring AFTER the time when you can access the
				sidequest, it is indeed a prerequisite.  Return to the "Gafka &amp; the Scrolls"
				node and head to Skalla.  Talk to Marco by the item shop.  Then, talk to Raynie
				by the inn and choose "I can't give up."  Talk to Marco again to complete this
				sidequest and receive the Priere Bonheur (ATK+15/MAG+32/Fear Res+5).  This
				sidequest is a prerequisite for unlocking the "A Warrior in Love" part of the
				true ending.
